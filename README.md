## A script for moving information from the Samanage helpdesk to an FMX Facility Maintenance helpdesk

This script has a *very* specific use case. I help manage the IT department at a facility and we use Samanage Helpdesk as part of a parent facility. We changed our local helpdesk to [FMX ](www.gofmx.com). FMX has a lot of great features but as a helpdesk it is designed primarily for facility maintenance. As such there is no agent to bring in data about computers. 

I am trying to learn Python so I thought I would use this problem as an exercise. I leveraged the Samanage helpdesk API and the FMX api to get them to talk to each other. I figured even if this exact use case didn't meet someone's need, they might be able to use some of the tricks I used in another situation
